                Traditional voting and event management platforms often come with a range of frustrating issues that make the process inefficient, slow and
                unreliable. Many platforms suffer from poor user interface(UI) and and user experience(UX) design. This results in a frustrating experience for
                event organizers and participants alike. Also, some platforms require you to contact the platform owners before you can even sign up, adding
                unnecessary steps and delays. Many platforms also charge high commissions for event management, which can be a significant burden on organizers.
