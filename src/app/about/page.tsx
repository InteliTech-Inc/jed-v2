                Traditional voting and event management platforms often come
                with a range of frustrating issues that make the process
                inefficient, slow and unreliable. Many platforms suffer from
                poor user interface(UI) and and user experience(UX) design. This
                results in a frustrating experience for event organizers and
                participants alike. Also, some platforms require you to contact
                the platform owners before you can even sign up, adding
                unnecessary steps and delays. Many platforms also charge high
                commissions for event management, which can be a significant
                burden on organizers.
